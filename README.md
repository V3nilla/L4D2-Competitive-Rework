# **L4D2 Competitive Rework**

<== IMPORTANT NOTICE DON'T IGNORE THIS OKAY?! ===>  
<------------------ **LINUX SUPPORT ONLY** ------------------>  
< The repo has some support for Windows, but I will not personally guarantee it's functionality >

## **About:**

This is mainly a project that focuses on reworking the very outdated platform for competitive L4D2 for **Linux** Servers.
It will contain both much needed fixes that are simply unable to be implemented on the older sourcemod versions as well as incompatible and outdated files being updated to working versions.

> **Included Matchmodes:**
* **Zonemod 2.5.3**
* **Zonemod Hunters 2.5**
* **Zonemod Retro 2.5**
* **NextMod 1.0.5**
* **Promod Elite 1.1**
* **Acemod RV 1**
* **Equilibrium 3.0c**
* **Apex 1.1.2**

---

## **Important Notes**
* We've added "**mv_maxplayers**" that replaces sv_maxplayers in the Server.cfg, this is used to prevent it from being overwritten every map change.
  * On config unload, the value will be to the value used in the Server.cfg
* Every Confogl matchmode will now execute 2 additional files, namely "**sharedplugins.cfg**" and "**generalfixes.cfg**" which are located in your **left4dead2/cfg** folder.
  * "**General Fixes**" simply ensures that all the Fixes discussed in here are loaded by every Matchmode.
  * "**Shared Plugins**" is for you, the Server host. You surely have some plugins that you'd like to be loaded in every matchmode, you can define them here. 
    * **NOTE:** Plugin load locking and unlocking is no longer handled by the Configs themselves, so if you're using this project do **NOT** define plugin load locks/unlocks within the configs you're adding manually.
